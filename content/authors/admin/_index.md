I am a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital, where I split my time between patient care and research. Clinically, I am interested in expanding access to mental health care. Scientifically, I want to understand what makes us intelligent and how these processes go awry in mental illness. My current work focuses on how cognitive resource limitations may give rise to psychopathology. 

I completed adult psychiatry residency at [MGH/McLean Hospital](https://mghmcleanpsychiatry.massgeneralbrigham.org/), where I worked with [Sam Gershman](https://gershmanlab.com/) on resource-bounded rationality. I completed my MD/PhD at Johns Hopkins and pursued a PhD in Neuroscience with [Jeremiah Cohen](https://cohenlab.johnshopkins.edu/). I characterized the neural circuitry (particularly cortico-basal-ganglia circuits) underlying flexible decision making. I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech.
