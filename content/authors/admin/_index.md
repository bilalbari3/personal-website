I am a <span style="color:red">some *red* text</span>.psychiatry resident at MGH/McLean Hospital. I am passionate about understanding what makes us intelligent and how these processes go awry in mental illness. I am broadly interested in computational psychiatry, particularly at the interface of cognitive science and psychiatry. I hope to develop computational theories of intelligence to better understand, diagnose, prognosticate, predict therapeutic response, and develop new treatments for mental illness.

I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech where I worked with [Garrett Stanley](https://stanley.gatech.edu/). I completed my MD/PhD at Johns Hopkins and pursued a PhD with [Jeremiah Cohen](https://cohenlab.johnshopkins.edu/). I characterized the neural circuitry (particularly cortico-basal-ganglia circuits) underlying flexible decision making. I collaborated with [Tricia Janak'](http://www.janaklab.com/)s lab to better characterize the role of basal ganglia circuits in motivated behavior and [Charlie Bradberry](https://irp.drugabuse.gov/staff-members/charles-w-bradberry-ph-d/)'s lab to characterize reversal learning behavior in squirrel monkeys.

Outside of my core research focus, I am interested in causal inference, statistical modeling (I am an unapologetic Bayesian), motor control, and medical decision making.
