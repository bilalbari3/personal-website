I am a psychiatry resident in the MGH/McLean Adult Psychiatry Residency Program. I am passionate about understanding what makes us intelligent, what gives rise to our cognition, and how these processes go awry in mental illness. I am broadly interested in computational psychiatry research in human subjects, particularly at the interface of cognitive science and psychiatry. I hope to use a theoretically-motivated perspective to better understand, diagnose, prognosticate, predict therapeutic response, and develop new treatments for mental illness.

I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. There, I was introduced to systems neuroscience research through [Garrett Stanley's lab](https://stanley.gatech.edu/). I fell in love with research and went on to complete my MD/PhD at Johns Hopkins. I pursued my PhD in [Jeremiah Cohen's lab](https://cohenlab.johnshopkins.edu/), where I characterized the neural circuitry (particularly cortico-basal-ganglia circuits) underlying flexible decision making. I also collaborated with [Patricia Janak's lab](http://www.janaklab.com/) to better characterize the role of basal ganglia circuits in motivated behavior.
