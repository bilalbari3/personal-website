One of my most memorable experiences in medical school was running down a back hallway at breakneck pace to save a patient's kidneys. The patient had been wheeled away for a CT scan with contrast just minutes prior and the attending staffing the emergency department had caught an error - the patient's kidney function was (slightly) worse than his threshold for comfort. Because contrast is excreted by the kidneys and may be nephrotoxic, there is a concern that those with poor kidney function may be injured further, leading to contrast-associated nephropathy<sup>1</sup> (see Joel Topf's [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kidney_boy/status/1199828796322598912) for a thoughtful summary).

A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine shows that may have been in vain<sup>1</sup>.
