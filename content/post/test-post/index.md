I am thrilled to start the next stage of my academic training at MGH/McLean Hospital. I will be pursuing psychiatry residency as part of the Physician Scientist Training Program, which will allow me the opportunity to conduct research during the latter years of residency. I plan to make a transition from neural circuits work in mice to cognitive science/psychology work in humans. Although the transition is fraught with risk, I am convinced we are at a unique moment where cognitive science can provide mathematically-rigorous theories of cognition in service of psychiatry.
