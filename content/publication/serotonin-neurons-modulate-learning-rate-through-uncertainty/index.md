abstract: Regulating how fast to learn is critical for flexible behavior.
  Learning about the consequences of actions should be slow in stable
  environments, but accelerate when that environment changes. Recognizing
  stability and detecting change is difficult in environments with noisy
  relationships between actions and outcomes. Under these conditions, theories
  propose that uncertainty can be used to modulate learning rates
  (“meta-learning”). We show that mice behaving in a dynamic foraging task
  exhibit choice behavior that varied as a function of two forms of uncertainty
  estimated from a meta-learning model. The activity of dorsal raphe serotonin
  neurons tracked both types of uncertainty in the foraging task, as well as in
  a dynamic Pavlovian task. Reversible inhibition of serotonin neurons in the
  foraging task reproduced changes in learning predicted by a simulated lesion
  of meta-learning in the model. We thus provide a quantitative link between
  serotonin neuron activity, learning, and decision making.
