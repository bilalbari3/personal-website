abstract: The locus coeruleus (LC) is a major hub of norepinephrine producing
  neurons that modulate a number of physiological functions. Structural or
  functional abnormalities of LC impact several brain regions including cortex,
  hippocampus, and cerebellum and may contribute to depression, bipolar
  disorder, anxiety, as well as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. These
  disorders are often associated with metal misbalance, but the role of metals
  in LC is only partially understood. Morphologic and functional studies of LC
  are needed to better understand the human pathologies and contribution of
  metals. Mice are a widely used experimental model, but the mouse LC is small
  (~0.3 mm diameter) and hard to identify for a non-expert. Here, we describe a
  step-by-step immunohistochemistry-based protocol to localize the LC in the
  mouse brain. Dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase (DBH), and alternatively, tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH), both enzymes highly expressed in the LC, are used as
  immunohistochemical markers in brain slices. Sections adjacent to
  LC-containing sections can be used for further analysis, including histology
  for morphological studies, metabolic testing, as well as metal imaging by
  X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM).
