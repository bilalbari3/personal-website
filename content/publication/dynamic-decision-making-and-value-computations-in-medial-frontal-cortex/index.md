abstract: Dynamic decision making requires an intact medial frontal cortex.
  Recent work has combined theory and single-neuron measurements in frontal
  cortex to advance models of decision making. We review behavioral tasks that
  have been used to study dynamic decision making and algorithmic models of
  these tasks using reinforcement learning theory. We discuss studies linking
  neurophysiology and quantitative decision variables. We conclude with
  hypotheses about the role of other cortical and subcortical structures in
  dynamic decision making, including ascending neuromodulatory systems.
