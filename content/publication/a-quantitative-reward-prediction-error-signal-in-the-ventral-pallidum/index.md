abstract: The nervous system is hypothesized to compute reward prediction errors
  (RPEs) to promote adaptive behavior. Correlates of RPEs have been observed in
  the midbrain dopamine system, but the extent to which RPE signals exist in
  other reward-processing regions is less well understood. In the present study,
  we quantified outcome history-based RPE signals in the ventral pallidum (VP),
  a basal ganglia region functionally linked to reward-seeking behavior. We
  trained rats to respond to reward-predicting cues, and we fit computational
  models to predict the firing rates of individual neurons at the time of reward
  delivery. We found that a subset of VP neurons encoded RPEs and did so more
  robustly than the nucleus accumbens, an input to the VP. VP RPEs predicted
  changes in task engagement, and optogenetic manipulation of the VP during
  reward delivery bidirectionally altered ratsâ€™ subsequent reward-seeking
  behavior. Our data suggest a pivotal role for the VP in computing teaching
  signals that influence adaptive reward seeking.
