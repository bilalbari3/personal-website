abstract: Making predictions about future rewards or punishments is fundamental
  to adaptive behavior. These processes are influenced by prior experience. For
  example, prior exposure to aversive stimuli or stressors changes behavioral
  responses to negative- and positive-value predictive cues. Here, we
  demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to
  the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC→PVT) in this process.
  We found that a history of punishments negatively biased behavioral responses
  to motivationally-relevant stimuli in mice and that this negative bias was
  associated with hyperactivity in mPFC→PVT neurons during exposure to those
  cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with
  selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the
  punishmentinduced negative behavioral bias. Together, our results highlight
  how information flow within the mPFC→PVT circuit is critical for making
  predictions about imminent motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of
  prior experience.
