abstract: Electrical microstimulation has been widely used to artificially
  activate neural circuits on fast time scales. Despite the ubiquity of its use,
  little is known about precisely how it activates neural pathways. Current is
  typically delivered to neural tissue in a manner that provides a locally
  balanced injection of positive and negative charge, resulting in negligible
  net charge delivery to avoid the neurotoxic effects of charge accumulation.
  Modeling studies have suggested that the most common approach, using a
  temporally symmetric current pulse waveform as the base unit of stimulation,
  results in preferential activation of axons, causing diffuse activation of
  neurons relative to the stimulation site. Altering waveform shape and using an
  asymmetric current pulse waveform theoretically reverses this bias and
  preferentially activates cell bodies, providing increased specificity. In
  separate studies, measurements of downstream cortical activation from
  sub-cortical microstimulation are consistent with this hypothesis, as are
  recent measurements of behavioral detection threshold currents from cortical
  microstimulation. Here, we compared the behavioral and electrophysiological
  effects of symmetric vs. asymmetric current waveform shape in cortical
  microstimulation. Using a go/no-go behavioral task, we found that
  microstimulation waveform shape significantly shifts psychometric performance,
  where a larger current pulse was necessary when applying an asymmetric
  waveform to elicit the same behavioral response, across a large range of
  behaviorally relevant current amplitudes. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging
  of cortex in anesthetized animals with simultaneous cortical microstimulation,
  we found that altering microstimulation waveform shape shifted the cortical
  activation in a manner that mirrored the behavioral results. Taken together,
  these results are consistent with the hypothesis that asymmetric stimulation
  preferentially activates cell bodies, albeit at a higher threshold, as
  compared to symmetric stimulation. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity
  of the pathway to varying electrical stimulation parameters and underscore the
  importance of designing electrical stimuli for optimal activation of neural
  circuits.
