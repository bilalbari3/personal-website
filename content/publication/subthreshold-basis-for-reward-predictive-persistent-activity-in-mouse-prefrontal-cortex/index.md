abstract: Nervous systems maintain information internally using persistent
  activity changes. The mechanisms by which this activity arises are
  incompletely understood. We study prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice performing
  behaviors in which stimuli predicted rewards at different delays with
  different probabilities. We measure membrane potential (Vm) from pyramidal
  neurons across layers. Reward-predictive persistent firing increases arise due
  to sustained increases in mean and variance of Vm and are terminated by reward
  or via centrally generated mechanisms based on reward expectation. Other
  neurons show persistent decreases in firing rates, maintained by persistent
  hyperpolarization that is robust to intracellular perturbation. Persistent
  activity is layer (L)- and cell-type-specific. Neurons with persistent
  depolarization are primarily located in upper L5, whereas those with
  persistent hyperpolarization are mostly found in lower L5. L2/3 neurons do not
  show persistent activity. Thus, reward-predictive persistent activity in PFC
  is spatially organized and conveys information about internal state via
  synaptic mechanisms.
