abstract: The locus coeruleus is a pontine nucleus that produces much of the
  brain’s norepinephrine. Despite its small size, the locus coeruleus is
  critical for a myriad of functions and is involved in many neurodegenerative
  and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we discuss the physiology and
  anatomy of the locus coeruleus system and focus on norepinephrine’s role in
  synaptic plasticity. We highlight Parkinson’s disease as a disorder with motor
  and neuropsychiatric symptoms that may be understood as aberrations in the
  normal functions of locus coeruleus.
