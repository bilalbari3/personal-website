abstract: We examined the relationships between activity in the locus coeruleus
  (LC), activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and pupil diameter in
  mice performing a tactile detection task. While LC spiking consistently
  preceded S1 membrane potential depolarization and pupil dilation, the
  correlation between S1 and pupil was more heterogeneous. Furthermore, the
  relationships between LC, S1, and pupil varied on timescales of sub-seconds to
  seconds within trials. Our data suggest that pupil diameter can be dissociated
  from LC spiking and cannot be used as a stationary index of LC activity.
