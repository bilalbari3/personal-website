abstract: The rapid detection of sensory inputs is crucial for survival. Sensory
  detection explicitly requires the integration of incoming sensory information
  and the ability to distinguish between relevant information and ongoing neural
  activity. In this study, head-fixed rats were trained to detect the presence
  of a brief deflection of their whiskers resulting from a focused puff of air.
  The animals showed a monotonic increase in response probability and a decrease
  in reaction time with increased stimulus strength. High-speed video analysis
  of whisker motion revealed that animals were more likely to detect the
  stimulus during periods of reduced self-induced motion of the whiskers,
  thereby allowing the stimulus-induced whisker motion to exceed the ongoing
  noise. In parallel, we used voltage sensitive dye (VSD) imaging of barrel
  cortex in anesthetized rats receiving the same stimulus set as those in the
  behavioral portion of this study to assess candidate codes that make use of
  the full spatiotemporal representation and to compare variability in the
  trial-by-trial nature of the cortical response and the corresponding
  variability in the behavioral response. By application of an accumulating
  evidence framework to the population cortical activity measured in separate
  animals, a strong correspondence was made between the behavioral output and
  the neural signaling, in terms of both the response probabilities and the
  reaction times. Taken together, the results here provide evidence for
  detection performance that is strongly reliant on the relative strength of
  signal versus noise, with strong correspondence between behavior and parallel
  electrophysiological findings
