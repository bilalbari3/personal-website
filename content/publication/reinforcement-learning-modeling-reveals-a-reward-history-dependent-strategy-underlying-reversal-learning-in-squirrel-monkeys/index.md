abstract: "Insight into psychiatric disease and development of therapeutics
  relies on behavioral tasks that study similar cognitive constructs in multiple
  species. The reversal learning task is one popular paradigm that probes
  flexible behavior, aberrations of which are thought to be important in a
  number of disease states. Despite widespread use, there is a need for a
  high-throughput primate model that can bridge the genetic, anatomic, and
  behavioral gap between rodents and humans. Here, we trained squirrel monkeys,
  a promising preclinical model, on an image-guided deterministic reversal
  learning task. We found that squirrel monkeys exhibited two key hallmarks of
  behavior found in other species: integration of reward history over many
  trials and a side-specific bias. We adapted a reinforcement learning model and
  demonstrated that it could simulate monkey-like behavior, capture
  training-related trajectories, and provide insight into the strategies animals
  employed. These results validate squirrel monkeys as a model in which to study
  behavioral flexibility."
