abstract: Decisions occur in dynamic environments. In the framework of
  reinforcement learning, the probability of performing an action is influenced
  by decision variables. Discrepancies between predicted and obtained rewards
  (reward prediction errors) update these variables, but they are otherwise
  stable between decisions. Although reward prediction errors have been mapped
  to midbrain dopamine neurons, it is unclear how the brain represents decision
  variables themselves. We trained mice on a dynamic foraging task in which they
  chose between alternatives that delivered reward with changing probabilities.
  Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, including projections to the
  dorsomedial striatum, maintained persistent firing rate changes over long
  timescales. These changes stably represented relative action values (to bias
  choices) and total action values (to bias response times) with slow decay. In
  contrast, decision variables were weakly represented in the anterolateral
  motor cortex, a region necessary for generating choices. Thus, we define a
  stable neural mechanism to drive flexible behavior.
