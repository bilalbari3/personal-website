abstract: The copper (Cu) transporters ATPase copper-transporting alpha (ATP7A)
  and ATPase copper-transporting beta (ATP7B) are essential for the normal
  function of the mammalian central nervous system. Inactivation of ATP7A or
  ATP7B causes the severe neurological disorders, Menkes disease and Wilson
  disease, respectively. In both diseases, Cu imbalance is associated with
  abnormal levels of the catecholamine-type neurotransmitters dopamine and
  norepinephrine. Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine by
  dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), which acquires its essential Cu cofactor from
  ATP7A. However, the role of ATP7B in catecholamine homeostasis is unclear.
  Here, using immunostaining of mouse brain sections and cultured cells, we show
  that DBH-containing neurons express both ATP7A and ATP7B. The two transporters
  are located in distinct cellular compartments and oppositely regulate the
  export of soluble DBH from cultured neuronal cells under resting conditions.
  Down-regulation of ATP7A, overexpression of ATP7B, and pharmacological Cu
  depletion increased DBH retention in cells. In contrast, ATP7B inactivation
  elevated extracellular DBH. Proteolytic processing and the specific activity
  of exported DBH were not affected by changes in ATP7B levels. These results
  establish distinct regulatory roles for ATP7A and ATP7B in neuronal cells and
  explain, in part, the lack of functional compensation between these two
  transporters in human disorders of Cu imbalance.
