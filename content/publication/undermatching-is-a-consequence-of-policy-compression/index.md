abstract: The matching law describes the tendency of agents to match the ratio
  of choices allocated to the ratio of rewards received when choosing among
  multiple options (Herrnstein, 1961). Perfect matching, however, is
  infrequently observed. Instead, agents tend to undermatch, or bias choices
  towards the poorer option. Overmatching, or the tendency to bias choices
  towards the richer option, is rarely observed. Despite the ubiquity of
  undermatching, it has received an inadequate normative justification. Here, we
  assume agents not only seek to maximize reward, but also seek to minimize
  cognitive cost, which we formalize as policy complexity (the mutual
  information between actions and states of the environment). Policy complexity
  measures the extent to which an agent's policy is state-dependent. Our theory
  states that capacity-constrained agents (i.e., agents that must compress their
  policies to reduce complexity), can only undermatch or perfectly match, but
  not overmatch, consistent with the empirical evidence. Moreover, we validate a
  novel prediction about which task conditions exaggerate undermatching.
  Finally, we argue that a reduction in undermatching with higher dopamine
  levels in patients with Parkinson's disease is consistent with an increased
  policy complexity.
